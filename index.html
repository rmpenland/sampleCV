                <p><em>Newbie programmer, Homeschool Administrator, Wife & Mother</em></p>
                <p>I am married to my best-friend for 23 years and a mother of 3.  I spent
                many years working for various large corporation in the financial sector before
                deciding to take a break from working outside the home in order to homeschool our
                3 children.  After 9 years, the kids being much older and more independent, I decided
                if I was to return to the workforce one day I didn't want to go back to what I had
                been doing.  I began my journey of learning to be a computer programmer and have thus
                far learned HTML, CSS, exposed to some JavaScript, and am in the process of learning
                Python.</p></td>
